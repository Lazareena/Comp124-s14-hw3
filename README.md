HW3
====

### Description
Please complete page 216, question number 5. You *must* include at least two separate classes in your program:

* Wheel, which has a spin() method that randomly generates a symbol (bell / orange / etc).
* Machine, which manages the game by spinning each of the wheels.

I've created empty java class for both Wheel and Machine, along with empty junit Tests for each of them.
You should write unit tests for every method unless it's impossible (it's not possible to test the run() method, for example).

### Development process
I would like you to try the following iterative *development process*.
It will help you avoid writing and debugging a huge, untested program.
Instead, you'll develop incremental pieces and test them as you go.

Before starting to write a lick of Java code, you have to know what you need to write. Begin with a planning session:

1. Sketch out the methods and attributes of the Wheel and Machine classes (on paper, not in Java)
2. Diagram how they'll work together - the parameters, return types, etc (again - on paper).

Take a photo of your diagram and commit it to your Repo.
We'll talk about it in class on Tuesday.
Accept that your plan (and therefore your code) will change as you encounter challenges.

Next, iteratively develop your application:
1. Choose one of the "low level" methods that's not dependent on calls to other methods.
2. Write code for the method.
3. Write a unit test for the method.
4. Repeat the previous steps until you're finished.

### Grading
I will be grading both the correctness of your program, and the style (readability).
You will have the opportunity to revise your program once based on my feedback before receiving a final grade.

Your goal for this assignment should be clear, readable code. Not code that just works.
In particular, make sure you've followed the [Java style guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V8BM38WXnBuVvTPilZMVCSuITLVW5VEfPKHaJ3uCZgc/edit?usp=sharing)
